A website for people to rent things from each other.
* Developer: <Name1>Ahmed Kutbi


## Long description

This website is to be used from people of the same city to offer or rent things from each other. All users can do both rent something or offer their things for the others to rent. The owner can offer the object for the price he wants and for the amount of deposit that he wants. The renter can make a request to rent an object for the duration he wants under the conditions chosen by the owner. The owner has then the choice to accept or reject the request. 15% of the price agreed on is the share of the website owner. The deposit is to be paid to the website itself and this deposit will go back to the renter if the object is returned in good condition. In case something happened to the object an investigation will be opened and it will be decided to whom the deposit or part of it should be paid. The deposit is to be pawned by the website authority until a decision is made in case of a problem with the returned object. The renter should get either a hand written confirmation or an online confirmation from the owner when the object is returned in good condition. The renter should confirm if the object has the correct description written by the owner on our platform.  Any defects that are not agreed on are to be paid/repaired by the renter.
